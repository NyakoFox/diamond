# What's that?

So, for this website, I decided to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a CSS framework where there's pretty much just a class for everything.

Take the following CSS, for example:

```css
.card {
  max-width: 256px;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  background-color: black;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  line-height: 1.75rem;
  text-align: center;
}
```
Now, we can make the exact same thing using Tailwind CSS:

```htmlbars
<div className="max-w-[256px] p-4 rounded-lg bg-black text-xl text-center">
  Hello world!
</div>
```

Clean, quick and simple. Right?

# I have a problem with it.

Well, like, I don't know if I like it.

I mean, it's probably great for people who are comfortable with it! But it just seems like it's a lot more thinking than CSS normally requires.
And then lines of classes get super long, you lose the ability to reuse classes (yes, I know about components, but inspect element doesn't!)
and it just feels like it makes things harder despite the goal be to make things easier.

With my example above, how do I remember any of that? `rounded-lg`? `text-xl`?
What are these magic sizes? How was I supposed to guess `rounded` from `border-radius`?
I guess it's another list of things I have to learn, but won't I get Tailwind mixed up with vanilla CSS?
