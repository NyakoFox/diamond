# What's that?

So, for this website, I decided to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
It's a CSS framework where there's pretty much just a class for everything.

Take the following CSS, for example:

```css
.card {
  max-width: 256px;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  background-color: black;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  line-height: 1.75rem;
  text-align: center;
}
```
Now, we can make the exact same thing using *Tailwind CSS*:

```htmlbars
<div className="max-w-[256px] p-4 rounded-lg bg-black text-xl text-center">
  Hello world!
</div>
```

Clean, quick and simple. Right?

# I have a problem with it.

Well, like, I don't know if I like it.

I mean, it's probably great for people who are comfortable with it! But it just seems like it's a lot more thinking than CSS normally requires.
And then lines of classes get super long, you lose the ability to reuse classes (yes, I know about components, but inspect element doesn't!)
and it just feels like it makes things harder despite the goal be to make things easier.

With my example above, how do I remember any of that? `rounded-lg`? `text-xl`?
What are these magic sizes? How was I supposed to guess `rounded` from `border-radius`?
What if I want to change my color palette while late in? I'd have to go through so many files to swap out colors...
And I know cheatsheets exist, but why would I want to use one of those instead of just using what I'm already comfortable with?

I guess it's another list of things I have to learn, but won't I get Tailwind mixed up with vanilla CSS?

# What if I'm the problem?

I'm not a designer. Maybe this is easier for other people with more experience?

I've been a backend developer for as long as I can remember, only touching frontend very occasionally.
What if the problems I have with *Tailwind CSS* aren't problems at all?
I mean, maybe I'm just bad at frontend!
And here I am, writing a blog post about this thing I don't fully understand, where I might just be making a fool of myself...

But a part of me is telling me I'm wrong and having complaints is *valid*.
I'm not the only one who feels this way; I've seen other people complain about issues like these as well.

# Excited

I was so excited to use *Tailwind CSS* for the first time.
Finally stepping into *real* webdev! *React*, *Tailwind CSS*, all of that fun stuff!
No more HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, now everything's JavaScript!
Everything works together! Components! Easy styles! Client-side page navigation!

But, well, now I'm just confused.
How is this better?

I mean, okay, *React* is really cool. Or, at least, I like components.
I don't really have an opinion on the rest of *React* yet other than it *seems* cool.
But maybe learning *Tailwind CSS* at the same time was a mistake? I don't know.

# Wrapping it up

I'll continue to use *Tailwind CSS* for this website, as I don't think it's worth the effort to change it.
I mean, I've already made most of the website, though it looks a little... bland. I mean, even my last website was more interesting than this.
But it genuinely seems like a cool idea, and I want to see if I'll become comfortable with it.
Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind and write a follow-up post about how cool and great it is.

So, I'll close with the following:

Why did I make each mention of *Tailwind CSS* in italics?
