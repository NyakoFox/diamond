# Okay so I made a blog.

So like, everyone's first React project is a blog. Like, every time I see a React tutorial, it's like, let's make a blog!
And I guess a blog is a pretty good way to learn React.

So I thought, hey, you know what? What if I did one too? So I made one. Don't look at the code.

Pages are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), with a meta object at the top of the file, looking something like the following:

```jsx
export const meta = {
  title: 'Doesn\'t everyone have one of these?',
  description: `Everyone's first React project is a blog, isn't it?`,
  date: 1686086481
}
```

Ignore how there's no syntax highlighting... I'll get to that later.

So, `BlogPost.jsx` dynamically imports the `.mdx` file using the slug in the URL, then renders it.

I've felt like I've just been stumbling through this project, with the actual dynamic page rendering taking most of the time.
Figuring out how to dynamically load the `.mdx` files was pretty tough,
and I haven't even figured out how to list all of the files yet for the main blog page.

Copilot also reminded me that I haven't figured out syntax highlighting despite there being a [guide on it](https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting/).

Honestly, I'm holding back from asking other people questions about what I should be doing,
because I don't want to rely too much on other people.
Like, some of my friends are [amazing with React](https://github.com/Rodentman87) and would be able to help me with pretty much anything,
but I'd probably get a better understanding if I'm able to do things on my own --
only AFTER would I ask if I did something well, or for more details on what something does, etc.

Does that make sense? Good. Now let's figure out everything else.

# Syntax highlighting

There's an entire [guide on this](https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting/), so it should be easy, right?

## It's never that easy

Immediately I noticed that neither of the examples work with how my code looks.
I stumbled around and googled endlessly until I finally pieced together how to do it.

Except, uh oh.

![The tags are flashing in devtools, which is never a good sign.](/posts/flashing-syntax-highlighting.gif)

Okay, let's just uh, disable that for now...

# GFM

Earlier, when writing about syntax highlighting, I wanted some strikethrough!
That's not included by default, so let's add it using my favorite thing ever: GitHub Flavored Markdown!

Okay, so I just install the module, add it as a remark plugin, and we should be good to go, right?

## It's never that easy 2: Electric Boogaloo

Check this out: ~~working strikethrough!~~ ... What do you mean it's not working?

The [guide](https://mdxjs.com/guides/gfm/) tells me to do **a single thing**. I did that thing. It's not working.

# "Conclusion"

Modern webdev seems wonderful. Everyone uses the modern methods for a reason, right?
But I'm here with my ancient HTML & CSS knowledge, and the only "dynamic" stuff I do is either server-side or some slapped together JS.
So moving to an ecosystem which is almost entirely JS, with a bunch of concepts that I've never heard of before, isn't very easy, to say the least.

I picked React because I hear about it the most, and some of my really good friends use it. Others say use Vue, or Svelte, or whatever.
I'm sure they're all great, but I'd rather mess with React since it seems like the most people use it.

But then there's the problem of... how do I practice React? I don't have site projects to work on!
I mean, everyone makes a blog, right? So I'll just make a blog! But it feels like I could have done this pretty easily with some basic HTML, CSS and some server-side thing such as Django.

It feels like, instead of just learning React, I have to learn all of these things alongside it, like how Vite works, how MDX works,
using Tailwind, etc. It's definitely a lot to take in, and while I didn't *have* to use MDX or Tailwind, I wanted to. I'll just... ask a friend for help later.

### I guess I just wish I didn't feel so helpless.
